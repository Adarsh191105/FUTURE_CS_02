Phishing Email Detection & Awareness Report<br>
Prepared By: Adarsh Dipak Gurav Prepared For: Future Interns<br> 
Date: 27 February 2026<br>

Overview:<br>
This repository contains documentation and a detailed analysis of five intercepted phishing email samples. These samples
demonstrate a diverse array of attack vectors designed to target both enterprise environments and personal consumer
accounts. The analysis breaks down each intercepted sample based on header intelligence, domain inspection,
psychological indicators, and overall risk classification.<br>

Prevention & Awareness Guidelines<br><br>
Based on the analysis of these samples, all staff should follow these actionable<br>
guidelines:<br>
Verify Sender Identity: Always expand the sender's details to view the actual email address, not just the
display name. Be highly suspicious of 'homoglyphs' (e.g., netfiix vs netflix) and free webmail accounts (Gmail/Yahoo)
claiming to be executives.<br><br>
Neutralize Urgency: Cybercriminals manufacture panic. If an email threatens account deletion,
payroll disruption, or demands a wire transfer within 30 minutes, stop. Do not click. Verify the request through a
secondary channel, such as calling the HR department or the CEO directly.<br><br>
Inspect URLs Before Clicking: Hover your mouse
over any 'Secure Document' or 'Update Payment' buttons. If the destination URL does not exactly match the official
corporate domain, close the email.<br><br>

Beware of the 'Changed Banking Details' Ploy: Any invoice claiming that routing
numbers or banking details have changed must be treated as hostile until verified by a phone call to a known contact at
the vendor.<br><br>

Treat Attachments as Toxic: Never open unexpected .xls, .doc, or .zip files, especially those from external
sources claiming to be invoices. These often contain macro-based malware or ransomware droppers.<br><br>

Report, Don't Just Delete: If you spot a phishing attempt, use the organization's 'Report Phishing' tool. Deleting it protects you, but
reporting it allows the SOC team to scrub the threat from the rest of the company's inboxes.
